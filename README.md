What is it?
====
The app is built on the idea that opportunities are everywhere, but people are not aware about them.<br>
This is a simple Android App built on top of Firebase which can serve as a medium for sharing resources among its users.<br>
The resources can be further broken down in 4 categories :
* Educational Resources
* Hackathons
* Meetups
* Technical talks

As on now, only the admins are allowed to add/remove content, so if you want to make youself an Admin, feel free to send a Pull Request in with your email address with which you signed up in the app and you'll be added up.
